    <p><p><strong>H2H&reg; Privacy Policy&nbsp;</strong><br /> To be read together with Terms and Conditions.&nbsp; By utilizing resources available on our Website and using <strong>HTH</strong> on your mobiles, you consent to the terms of this policy. You also thereby agree to be bound by our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> and to our <strong>Terms and Conditions.</strong></p> <p>All individuals are entitled to the following rights&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Under General Data Protection Regulations Law, individual&rsquo;s rights include the right .... :</strong></p> <ul><li>to be informed</li><li>to have access</li><li>to rectification</li><li>to deletion or erasure</li><li>to restrict processing &nbsp;</li><li>to data portability &nbsp;</li><li>to object</li><li>not to be subject to automated decision-making including profiling.</li> </ul> <p>Once you have read this document you will have insight into how <strong>H2H</strong> complies with these rights. Also you can structure your requests based on the information that we maintain.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What types&nbsp; of information do we collect?</strong><br /> As a user of <strong>H2H</strong>, data about a Company or individual&nbsp; including personal information is stored.</p> <p><strong>What is personal data?</strong></p> <p>Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable person who could be identified, directly or indirectly based on the information.</p> <p>The EU-wide <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, brought into UK law on 25 May 2018 under the newly revised Data Protection Act 2018, broadened the definition of what counts as personal data.</p> <p>Personal data includes an identifier such as</p> <ul><li>your name</li><li>an identification number, such as your National Insurance or passport number</li><li>your location data, such as your home address or mobile phone GPS data</li><li>an online identifier, such as your IP or email address.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Basic personal information</strong><br /> <strong>H2H</strong> collects your contact information, such as your name and email address. This is used to compile a unique user account so that authentication to the site and authorization to specific rights can be compiled. Email accounts are used strictly for correspondence purposes and are not supplied or sold to outside agencies. The email address of your householder within your run must be acquired through consent when a direct debit mandate is to be sent to them by email by you.</p> <p>We may also collect personal information such as your mobile number, address including housenumber, street address, postcode, taxation details and accounting and financial information directly from you when you use the service.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is your choice what personal information you give us, but if you don&rsquo;t supply some required information, we may not be able to provide you with the service.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Log Data Files</strong><br /> When you access the service by or through a mobile device, we may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use and other statistics (&quot;Log Data Files&quot;). This is in order to improve our service and for troubleshooting and to provide support within the service. It is used as part of data that is accumulated in order to provide information. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Payment information</strong><br /> <strong>H2H</strong> doesn&rsquo;t store any payment information specifically bank details.&nbsp; These are kept&nbsp; with our two payment&nbsp; providers Paypal and Gocardless. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Address information</strong><br /> Because of the location based services within <strong>H2H</strong>, on devices using <strong>H2H</strong>, <strong>H2H </strong>uses a housenumber and street address to provide the location to Google Maps so that users can locate the clean location from their mobile phone. This information that is given to Google Maps is concatenated&nbsp; or joined from the Postcode category and Street subcategory tables. Both these categories are compiled by the round manager or user. <strong>H2H</strong> does not use tracking to locate cleaners&#39; current location. Although a mobile number is considered a personal identifier and can be used for tracking an individual, and even an&nbsp; IP address is considered a personal identifier, according to GDPR law, we do not encourage the taking of firstnames and surnames from householders in association with mobile numbers. It is advised to keep these fields blank or at least with sudonyms unless you have consent from the householder to keep this information within the <strong>H2H</strong> application. So use the fields email, mobile number, firstname, and surname within your run with caution. All post codes are categorised so that you have a main category eg. &quot;G7 - Yourpostcategory&quot;. Streets are then subcategorized under the main post code. And finally only the housenumber is associated with the clean. Thus maintaining address separation. The actual post code may be entered in two halves. These are non-required fields and are therefore optional.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>H2H Cookie information</strong><br /> <strong>H2H</strong> utilizes &quot;cookies&quot;. Cookies are small text files that are&nbsp; stored on your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie does not identify you personally or contain any other information about you but it does identify your computer.</p> <p>We and some of our partners including Paypal and Gocardless may use a combination of &ldquo;persistent cookies&rdquo;. These are cookies that remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. The Yii2 framework that we use uses&nbsp; &ldquo;session ID cookies&rdquo;&nbsp; or cookies that expire when you close your browser. These may be used to track overall site usage. We do not generate advertising revenues from this site and will refuse to provide a platform to outside agencies to advertise from this site.<br /> Browser settings can be adjusted to notify you when you receive a cookie. This will give you the opportunity&nbsp; to either accept or reject it in each instance. Refusing cookies may impact on the functionality and usability of this website.</p> <p><strong>Information belonging to others</strong><br /> As a user of <strong>H2H,</strong> you will also collect information from others, which is stored on your account. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are authorised to disclose that information to us. This means that you must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual or householder concerned is aware of and/or consents to the various matters detailed in this Policy, including:</p> <ul><li>the fact that their personal information is being collected namely their email for sending Gocardless Mandates to them, their Mobile number for contacting them to arrange a clean. It is optional whether firstnames and surnames are stored. They are not required and not validated on entry.</li><li>the purposes for which that information is being collected namely to facilitate a detailed recording and future scheduling of cleans and corresponding payment against these cleans. Assisting workers in finding addresses of these cleans.&nbsp;</li><li>the intended recipients of that information,&nbsp;</li><li>the individual&#39;s right to obtain access to that information,&nbsp;</li><li>Roundrunner&#39;s&nbsp; identity,&nbsp;</li><li>and how to contact us.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><br /> Since you will have exclusive access to your database but not to the framework or code that manages your database , when requested to do so by us, you will assist any of your householders of your run where requested to do so by us, to implement their requests to access or update the personal information you have collected from them and entered into your database.&nbsp; You will have the responsibility to liase with your householder to the extent that their request is best satisfied. The fields mobile number, email, firstname, and surname are all non-required fields in the database meaning that you do not have to fill them in in order to achieve functionality in the program. ie. They are not validated for compulsory entry. This is to assist with compliance with the GDPR law. It is suggested that descriptions be used in firstname, and surname. Mobile numbers in themselves do not identify an individual unless associated with GPS tracking.&nbsp; You will be solely, and legally responsible for ensuring that this information is kept confidential and that the householder has consented to you storing this information. Firstname defaults to firstname, Surname defaults to surname, and mobile number defaults to 07777777777. Householders must consent to their email address being stored for the purposes of sending a Gocardless mandate. Please bear in mind that if you choose to use Gocardless you will be charged a minimum of &pound; 0.20 per transaction in order to get collection from your householder.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why is your personal information collected, held, and used by us?</strong></p> <p>Your personal information is collected so that we can provide you with a&nbsp; service.
