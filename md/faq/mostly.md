It has been built for **window cleaning** in the **UK** but can be modified for other service based companies. **Data protection** has been considered carefully in the package so most fields under the **Product table** (House) do not require data input and these fields are therefore not listed under the **'required'** fields. Refer to the suggested Privacy and Data Protection Policy under the /site/privacypolicy url when the site is hosted or under **frontend/views/site/privacypolicy.php.**. [Back](/md/faq/faqs.md)
