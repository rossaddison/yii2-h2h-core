The quickest method will be to simply create a **SQL export data file** for the **auth_assignment**, **auth_item**, and **auth_item_child tables** from your phpMyadmin. After you have imported them using phpMyadmin you can then assign these roles to the users that signup or that you as admin internally signup **using the RBAC GUI User Management** The auth_assignment table will then be populated with the **roles** and respective **user_id**. You will not need to include these values in any migration file since these values only pertain to the db database and not to the subsequent databases for other companies sharing the site ie. db1, db2.
